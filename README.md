# Machine-Learning-for-Weather-Prediction

Using Machine Learning in Python Programming to predict weather (rainfall) in Subang Jaya, Malaysia based on variables. The dataset was obtained from NASA meteorology, with variables such as Rainfall (target variable), Irradiation, Maximum Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Surface Pressure and Wind Speed to produce a final Machine Learning prediction for rainfall to occur. 



The dataset had pre-processing, as the column names had to be changed, and continuous variables had to be converted to categorical variables (such as Month). Once Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted, a correlation map was produced to investigate the correlating variables in the dataset that would affect the final outcome. 



Next, using Linear Regression, the final prediction of rainfall based on the variables entered into the regression was produced.
